This website was built by me a few years back after I started working as a software engineer, but recently I've decided to revive it and begin blogging about my professional and personal life. I hope by maintaining a personal website and blog I can enjoy development in a new and unfamiliar environment, and even perhaps learn some useful things. Additionally, I hope this will improve my professional ability to transfer knowledge, and help motivate me to be more hands on with the new content I'm learning about within big data.
