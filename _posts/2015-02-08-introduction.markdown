This website was built by me a few years back after I started working as a software engineer, but recently I've decided to revive it and begin blogging about my professional and personal life. I hope by maintaining a personal website and blog I can enjoy development in a new and unfamiliar environment, and even perhaps learn some useful things. Additionally, I hope this will improve my professional ability to transfer knowledge, and help motivate me to be more hands on with the new content I'm learning about within big data. I also plan to share some of my life with my family and friends, and will chronicle the experiences of the little family I have with my wife Jeni and our son Parker. These posts will serve as a time capsule for Jeni and me, and give Parker a place to reminisce and rediscover things from his childhood. Perhaps, with a little encouragement, I can even get Jeni to write some blogs with me.

The first series of personal posts will chronicle the adventures Jeni and I had on our vacation to Costa Rica, which starts and ends in San Jos√©. We traveled by rental car around the country side and alongside the Caribbean coast.

The first series of professional posts will be covering material from "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide". I hope by blogging on each chapter I can establish a stronger foundation with the material and provide some valuable content for others to read.
