                        <h2>Brief History</h2>
                        <p>I am an interdisciplinary software engineer with a background in computer and pharmaceutical sciences. I graduated from The University of Toledo in 2009 with a Bachelor of Sciences in Pharmaceutical Sciences. After a summer spent abroad in Budapest, Hungary doing computational pharmaceutical research, I entered into a graduate program in Computer Science and subsequently earned an MS in Computer Sciences in 2012. I moved to Kansas City in February of 2013 to begin my professional career at <a href="http://www.cerner.com">Cerner</a>, and landed a job on the big data team.</p>

                        <h2>Currently</h2>
                        <p>I am currently working as a software engineer for <a href="http://www.cerner.com">Cerner</a>. I work with big data technologies mostly within and adjacent to the Hadoop ecosystem. My present focus is on data ingestion; where we are taking crawled data from our clients and landing it in the cloud.</p>
